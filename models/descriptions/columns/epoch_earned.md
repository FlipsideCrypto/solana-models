{% docs epoch_earned %}

The epoch that rewards were recieved for. Staking and voting rewards for an epoch are recieved in the first block of the following epoch, so this would identify the prior epoch, which is where the rewards were determined. Fee and rent rewards are determined in the epoch they are recieved.
