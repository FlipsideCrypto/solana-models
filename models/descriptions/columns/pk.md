{% docs pk %}
A unique, stable identifier for each record in this table. The primary key (PK) ensures that every row is uniquely identifiable and supports efficient joins, lookups, and data integrity across models. The PK may be a natural key (such as a blockchain transaction hash) or a surrogate key generated from one or more fields, depending on the table's structure and requirements.
