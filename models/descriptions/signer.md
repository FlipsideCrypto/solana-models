{% docs signer %}
The Solana address (public key, base58-encoded) that signed the transaction. Signers are responsible for authorizing transactions and may represent users, programs, or system accounts. In most cases, the first signer is the fee payer. This field enables analysis of user activity, protocol adoption, and transaction attribution. Example: '7Ggk7Q2...'.
