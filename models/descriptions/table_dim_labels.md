{% docs table_dim_labels %}
Contains one row per labeled address or entity on the Solana blockchain. This table maps Solana addresses to human-readable labels, label types, subtypes, creators, and project names, supporting entity resolution, attribution, and analytics. Labels are classified by type (e.g., cex, dex, dapp, games) and subtype (e.g., contract_deployer, hot_wallet, token_contract) to enable granular segmentation and analysis. Data is sourced from a combination of automated algorithms, manual curation, protocol APIs, and community submissions. Automatic labels are generated based on on-chain behavior, contract deployments, and protocol integrations, while manual and community labels capture new protocols, exchange wallets, and trending addresses. All labels are reviewed for accuracy and can be updated or removed as needed. This model supports analytics on protocol adoption, ecosystem mapping, and address attribution for Solana.
