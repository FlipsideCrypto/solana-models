    description: |-
      Records every event emitted by on-chain Solana programs during transaction execution. Each row represents a single event, including its type, the program that emitted it, and its position within the transaction. This table covers all events observed on Solana mainnet, including protocol-level and application-level activity. It enables detailed analysis of program behavior, user actions, and protocol interactions at the event level. Events are uniquely identified by block, transaction, and event index. This model is central to understanding the full scope of on-chain activity and supports downstream analytics, including decoded instructions, transfers, and protocol-specific event flows.
