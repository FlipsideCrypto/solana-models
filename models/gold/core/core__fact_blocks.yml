    description: |-
      Contains one row per block produced on the Solana blockchain, mapping block-level metadata as recorded on-chain. Includes block identifiers, timestamps, hashes, network and chain information, and lineage to previous blocks. This model is sourced from upstream block data and serves as a foundational table for block-level analytics, supporting chain monitoring, block production analysis, and cross-chain integrations. Data is updated as new blocks are processed, and each row represents a unique block with associated metadata and computed fields. See upstream lineage for details on data extraction and transformation.
