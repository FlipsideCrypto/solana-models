    description: This table contains swaps performed on Jupiter, Orca, Raydium, Saber, Bonkswap, Dooar and Meteora swap programs. Intermediate swaps are aggregated over the DEX programs, so the values showcase the final mint/amount swap values. Ie. a swap on Jupiter that swaps SOL->USDC->mSOL->ETH would show the initial amount in and the final amount out of SOL->ETH.
