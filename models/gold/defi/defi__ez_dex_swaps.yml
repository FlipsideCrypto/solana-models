    description: A convenience table containing swaps performed on Jupiter (V2, V3), Orca, Raydium, Saber, Bonkswap, Dooar, Phoenix, Meteora, Pumpswap, and Pumpfun swap programs.

NOTE - Jupiter (V4, V5, V6) aggregator swaps exist in defi.fact_swaps_jupiter_summary, and individual routes are present in defi.fact_swaps_jupiter_inner.
